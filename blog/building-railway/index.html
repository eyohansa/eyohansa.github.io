<h1>Building Railway</h1>



<p>I have been playing Satisfactory recently, with a friend, ever since its 1.0 launch. I've bought the game a long time ago when it was on a discount but haven't had a chance to play it. The launch has given me motivation to push everything else aside and finally played the game.</p>
<p>I've been having a blast with the game. I've always enjoyed factory-building games; having previously played Factorio and Dyson Sphere Program (my personal favorite). I guess I enjoy seeing numbers go up. It also helps that resource nodes don't deplete in this game so it's actually possible to never tidy your factory; no matter how unsightly it becomes.</p>
<p>Today, I spent most of my time building the in-game railway. I built mine on top of water on the Northwestern area; going from a Caterium Ore node West of my spawn, up to the oil fields in the North. Building above water means placing a lot of foundations.</p>
<p>Building foundations over the span of vast areas requires a lot of resources. Usually, carrying this many resources would fill up a player's inventory. Thankfully, ever since the launch, Satisfactory provides player with really nifty dimensional storage.</p>

<p>It looks quite majestic once finished</p>

<p>Aside from the tedious task of laying down foundation, the setting up was actually quite straightforward. I even managed to make it runs autonomously. It periodically brings a batch of plastic (and eventually, rubber) to my outpost which would bring it over to my base with conveyor belts. It's definitely a beauty to behold.</p>
<p>Is it too late to say I quite like trains?</p>
